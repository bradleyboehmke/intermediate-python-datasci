    "1. Load in the data in `companies.csv` and `prices.csv` (in the data folder).\n",
    "2. Write a function `is_incorporated` that checks whether an input string, `name`, contains the substring \"inc\" or \"Inc\". Its definition should look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_incorporated(name):\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Yes, all these companies are incorporated, but bear with us for the exercise.)\n",
    "3. Test this function to be sure it works. Try passing in some strings that contain the substring and some that don't. Test it on data from the companies DataFrame.\n",
    "4. Write a `for` loop to iterate through the elements in the Name column of the companies data, applying `is_incorporated` to each element and printing the result.\n",
    "5. Now rewrite the code for #4 using the `Series.apply` method -- apply the function to the Series and print the resulting Series.\n",
    "6. *Similar, but less guided.* Create a new column, name_length, whose value is:\n",
    "    - `\"long\"` if the company name is over 12 characters\n",
    "    - `\"medium\"` if the company name is 8-11 characters\n",
    "    - `\"short\"` if the company name is 7 or fewer characters.\n",
    "7. Write a function `make_colname_string` that takes a DataFrame as an argument and returns a string that contains all the DataFrame's columns' names, comma separated. For example, running `make_colname_string` on our companies data would look like this:<br><br>\n",

Create a dataset of the form:\n",
    "| Name | Symbol | Projected |\n",

    "\n",
    "Where \"Projected\" is the projected price of the company's stock (2x, 1x, .5x as explained above). Note that you will need to join companies to prices and do some data wrangling operations."

Whiile training and running your model should have been pretty fast, imagine that you are working with orders of magnitude more data -- so you want to train the model overnight, rather than interactively. Export your Jupyter notebook as a script and kick it off from the command line. Make sure it still works!\n",
    "6. Think back to Lesson 8, on the data science ecosystem. Which package sounded most interesting to you? If you are working on a platform with conda, create a new environment called \"temporary\", activate it, and install that package in it. Try to import it in a notebook (remember you'll need to get your conda environment working in Jupyter), and look in the online documentation (just google \"package-name docs\") to figure out what you can do with this package."
